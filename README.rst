get-pip.py
==========

``get-pip.py`` is a bootstrapping script that enables users to install pip,
setuptools, and wheel in Python environments that don't already have them. You
should not directly reference the files located in this repository and instead
use the versions located at https://bootstrap.pypa.io/.


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Install the latest version of pip
    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
    $ # Install the latest version of pip, supported by a legacy Python
    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/3.2/get-pip.py | python3.2
    $ # Install a specific version of pip
    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python - 'pip==8.0.0'


Development
-----------

Most of the work of ``get-pip.py`` comes from the copy of pip that is bundled
inside of it. However, there is a tiny bit of glue code located inside of
``template.py`` to enable ``get-pip.py`` to actually work.

Install the dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` to get setup with the repo.
You may want to perform something like:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Any pull request should include regenerated files, which can be generated by
running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ invoke generate


Discussion
